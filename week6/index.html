        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I understand testing is important but how often is it used before writing code where they explain Test-driven development (TDD)? <br>
                I personally think I would write the program first then test it as logically that makes more sense to me.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>During this semseter are we required to develop any test files? I really struggled with creating test files in Python so I hope to learn how to make good working test files.

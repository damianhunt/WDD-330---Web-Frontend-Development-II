        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When my team and I were doing our team activity this week we tried both the arrow method and the more traditional way of creating functions with names, Which method of creating functions is used more in the industry?
                I would like to better my skills in using the arrow method as it looks better and saves allot of space when writing allot of lines of code.</li>
